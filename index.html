           <p class="text">Colonel Maharaja Raol Sir Shri Krishna Kumarsinhji Bhavsinhji KCSI (19 May 1912 – 2 April 1965) was an Indian king and politician, the last ruling Maharaja of the Gohil dynasty, who ruled Bhavnagar State from 1919 to 1948 and also served as the first Indian Governor of Madras from 1948 to 1952. After the handover of rule of the Bhavnagar State as part of the Indian Union, Bhavnagar became the first state which joined the Indian Union.</p><br>

           <p class="text2">Krishna Kumarsinhji Bhavsinhji was born in Bhavnagar on 19 May 1912, the eldest son and heir of Maharaja Bhavsinhji II of Bhavnagar (1875–1919, r. 1896–1919). Kumarsinhji succeeded his father upon his death in 1919; only seven years old, he ascended the Bhavnagar throne under a regency until 1931. He was educated at Rajkumar College, Rajkot like his father and grandfather, who was the first student in 1870.</p><br>

           <p class="text3">Kumarsinhji continued the progressive reforms of his father and grandfather, reforming the method of tax-collection in his state, introducing village councils and Bhavnagar's first legislature, the Dharasabha. Owing to his progressive reign, Kumarsinhji was knighted with the KCSI in 1938; however, he remained quietly committed to the cause of Indian independence. Therefore, upon Independence in 1947, Kumarsinhji became among the first of the Indian monarchs to accede to the Dominion of India in 1947. He merged Bhavnagar into the state of Kathiawad in 1948.<br><br>

            Maharaja Shri Bhavsinhji Polytechnic Institute was established by him in commemoration of his father Late Sir Bhavsinhji II in 1932, which commenced functioning in 1949.</p>
